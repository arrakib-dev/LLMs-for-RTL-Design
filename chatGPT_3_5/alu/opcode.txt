 The logic and arithmetic operations being implemented in the ALU are as follows:
0. Arithmetic Addition (0000)
ALU_Out = A + B;

1. Arithmetic Subtraction (0001)
ALU_Out = A - B;

2. Arithmetic Multiplication
ALU_Out = A * B;

3. Arithmetic Division
ALU_Out = A / B;

4. Logical Shift Left
ALU_Out = A logical shifted left by 1;

5. Logical Shift Right
ALU_Out = A logical shifted right by 1;

6. Rotate Left
ALU_Out = A rotated left by 1;

7. Rotate Right
ALU_Out = A rotated right by 1;

8. Logical AND
ALU_Out = A AND B;

9. Logical OR
ALU_Out = A OR B;

10. Logical XOR
ALU_Out = A XOR B;

11. Logical NOR
ALU_Out = A NOR B;

12. Logical NAND
ALU_Out = A NAND B;

13. Logical XNOR
ALU_Out = A XNOR B;

14. Greater comparison
ALU_Out = 1 if A > B else 0;

15. Equal comparison
ALU_Out = 1 A = B else 0;
